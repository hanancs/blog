##  What's Wrong With "Imagine" by John Lennon?
Many people would acclaim this song would be the greatest song ever written!! But what does the Bible really tell you(including me) about heaven and its existence? Can all the people livin' life in peace? Why is our world not a country(One Nation)? So many seemingly good questions to think about.. Mmm.. I will walk you through the entire song and figure out what wrong's with Lennon's thoughts and not just his, but the dream of many(World's view)? 

> Imagine there's no heaven  
It's easy if you try
